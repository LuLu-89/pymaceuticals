Observable trends on pharmaceutical data:
1. Over a period of 45 days, Capomulin showed the greatest decrease in tumor volume and greatest survival rate.
2. Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo showed consistent results of poor tumor response to the drugs and poor survival rates compared to Capomulin.
3. Metastatic spread had similar increasing trends across all drugs but in the end, Capomulin was the only one (out of the four evaluated) that showed a decrease in tumor volume in 45 days.
